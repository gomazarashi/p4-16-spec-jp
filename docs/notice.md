# NOTICE

This project contains a non-official Japanese translation (work in progress) and derived formatting of the “P4-16 Language Specification” by The P4 Language Consortium and contributors.

The content is based on the official specification version 1.2.5 (tag: P4-16-v1.2.5), and has been split by sections, converted from Madoko to Markdown, and adjusted for publication as a website using MkDocs. At present, many chapters remain in English and cross-references are not fully resolved; translation is ongoing.

This project is an unofficial community effort and is not affiliated with or endorsed by The P4 Language Consortium.
