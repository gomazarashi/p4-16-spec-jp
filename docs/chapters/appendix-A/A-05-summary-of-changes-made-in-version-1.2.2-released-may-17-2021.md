  - Added support for accessing tuple fields (Section
    \[\#sec-tuple-exprs\]).
  - Added support for generic structures (Section \[\#sec-type-spec\]).
  - Added support for integers, `enum`s, and `error`s in `switch`
    statements (Section \[\#sec-switch-stmt\]).
  - Added support for additional enumeration types (Section
    \[\#sec-enum-types\]).
  - Added support for abstract methods (Section
    \[\#sec-abstract-methods\]).
  - Added support for conditional statements and empty statements in
    parsers (Section \[\#sec-parser-state-stmt\]).
  - Added support for casts from `int` to `bool` (Section
    \[\#sec-casts\]).
  - Added support for 0-width bitstrings and varbits (Section
    \[\#sec-uninitialized-values-and-writing-invalid-headers\]).
  - Clarified that `default_action` is `NoAction` if otherwise
    unspecified (Section \[\#sec-tables\]).
  - Clarified the types of expressions that may be used as indexes for
    header stacks (Section \[\#sec-expr-hs\]).
  - Clarified representation of Booleans in headers (Section
    \[\#sec-header-types\]).
  - Clarified representation of empty types (Section
    \[\#sec-uninitialized-values-and-writing-invalid-headers\]).
  - Clarified that action data can be specified by the control plane,
    `default_action` table property, or `const entries` table property
    (Section \[\#sec-actions\]).
  - Fixed several typos and inconsistencies in grammar (Section
    \[\#sec-grammar\]).
  - Eliminated annotations on `const` entries in grammar (Section
    \[\#sec-grammar\]).
