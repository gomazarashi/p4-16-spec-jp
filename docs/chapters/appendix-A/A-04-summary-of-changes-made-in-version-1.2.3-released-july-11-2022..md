  - Extended `minSizeInBits` and `minSizeInBytes` to apply to more
    expressions (Section \[\#sec-minsizeinbits\]).
  - Added support for `maxSizeInBits` and `maxSizeInBytes` (Section
    \[\#sec-minsizeinbits\]).
  - Added support for empty lists of const entries in tables (Section
    \[\#sec-entries\]).
  - Added support for `switch` statements in actions (Section
    \[\#sec-actions\]).
  - Added support for direct invocation of controls and parsers (Section
    \[\#sec-parameterization\]).
  - Added parser `value_set` to list of control-plane visible names
    (Section \[\#sec-cp-names\]).
  - Added `match_kind` as a base type (Section
    \[\#sec-match-kind-type\]).
  - Removed structure initializers as they are subsumed by
    structure-valued expressions (Section
    \[\#sec-structure-expressions\]).
  - Specified operations on values typed as type variables (Section
    \[\#sec-type-variable-operations\]).
  - Clarified semantics of compile-time known values (Section
    \[\#sec-compile-time-known\]).
  - Clarified semantics of directionless parameters (Section
    \[\#sec-calling-convention\]).
  - Clarified semantics of arbitrary precision integers (Section
    \[\#sec-arbitrary-precision-integers\]).
  - Clarified semantics of bit slices, shifts, and concatenation
    (Section \[\#sec-bit-ops\]).
  - Clarified semantics of optional parameters (Section
    \[\#sec-optional-parameters\]).
  - Clarified restrictions on extern method and function invocation
    (Section \[\#sec-calling-restrictions\]).
  - Clarified semantics of implicit casts (Section
    \[\#sec-implicit-casts\]).
